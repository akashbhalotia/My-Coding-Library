Sum of first N squares: N(N+1)(2N+1)/6   

Sum of first N odd numbers = N^2     

Number of divisors of N is approximately O(N^(1/3))   

Number of primes <=N is approximately = N/ln(N)

a^(-1) = a^(m-2) mod m, if a and m are co-prime.
Also, (a^n)^(-1) is simply (a^(-1))^n obviously.

Cosine rule, for finding the sides and angles of a triangle: a^2=b^2+c^2-2*b*c*cos(A) 

Goldbach Conjecture:    
Every even number greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of 2 primes.    
Odd number N can be represented only if N-2 is prime. Otherwise, it can be represented as 3
and then two other primes adding up to N-3.

a + b = (a ^ b) + 2(a & b)      
a + b = (a | b) + 2(a & b)     
a ^ b = (a | b) - (a & b)

Upto 1e12, gap between two consecutive primes is at most 300.
