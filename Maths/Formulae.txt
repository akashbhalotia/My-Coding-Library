Sum of first N squares: N(N+1)(2N+1)/6   

Sum of first N odd numbers = N^2     

Number of divisors of N is approximately O(N^(1/3))   

Number of primes <=N is approximately = N/ln(N)

a^(-1) = a^(m-2) mod m, if a and m are co-prime.
Also, (a^n)^(-1) is simply (a^(-1))^n obviously.

Cosine rule, for finding the sides and angles of a triangle: a^2=b^2+c^2-2*b*c*cos(A)
